Project description:
An artificial intelligence project - a handwriting recognition system. The system works on a scanned form uploaded from the computer.
After uploading the form it  goes through a process of cutting letters written by hand on the form and arranging the cut letters into a neural network,
(turning into black and white, changing the size and resolution...).
The cut letters are sent for identification by a neural network previously trained by a database,
system that  is based on an artificial intelligence model (from VGG16) and various learned algorithms.
